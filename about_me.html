      <h2>My background</h2>
      <p>
        I have a strong interest in web design and digital creativity. 
        To me, this kind of work brings together both technical skills 
        and aesthetics. A website feels like a vibrant product. I'm also 
        drawn to the business side of it, which involves a lot of creativity 
        and potential. Learning the skills and knowledge in this field will 
        help me take part in this exciting space.

      <h2>My interests</h2>
      <p>
        One of my favorite hobbies is finding great food spots. 
        Whether it’s a street vendor selling skewers or a hidden noodle shop, 
        I love exploring new flavors and the stories behind them. 
        Food has deep meaning in culture and is also one of life’s great pleasures.
